      accordionContent: [<p>FAINs and URIs are types of unique identifiers — unique (within a given agency) sequences of
        characters that are tied to each financial assistance award throughout its lifespan. </p>,
      <p>The FAIN (Federal Award Identification Number) is an identification code assigned to a specific financial
        assistance award by an agency for tracking purposes. The FAIN is tied to that award (and all future
        modifications to that award) throughout the award's life, which allows users to track all the spending
        made on a single award. Within an agency, FAINs are unique; a new award must be issued a new FAIN.
        The FAIN may contain both numbers and letters.</p>,
        <p>The URI is similar to the FAIN, but its <span className={styles.bold}>only</span> intended use is as a unique identifier for an aggregate record.
        Aggregate records display awards made to individual recipients by county, state, or foreign country in
        order to protect the recipients’ personally identifiable information. Because they are themselves
        aggregations covering a particular time period, aggregate awards are typically not modified with future
        transactions. As such, URIs (in their capacity as the unique award identifier of aggregate records) are
        generally only used once.</p>]
