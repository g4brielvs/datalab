        <p>In the federal award landscape, spending is captured by the Federal Action Obligation field—<span className={styles.bold}>except in
          the case of loans.</span></p>,
        <p>There are two data elements particular to loans: the Face Value and the Subsidy Cost. Because federal
          loans are expected to be repaid, the amount loaned out (the principal or Face Value) is not considered
          federal spending. It only becomes federal spending if and when the loan becomes unrecoverable in whole
          or part (through default, bankruptcy, loan forgiveness, and so on). This is where subsidy cost comes in.
          Subsidy cost is an estimation, made by the government, of what the loan will cost it over time; it’s
          calculated based on a credit model particular to the program and, in some cases, the recipient’s
          characteristics or credit history. Subsidy cost allows the government to budget for potential defaults on
          loans. It is the loan equivalent of federal spending, and when estimated accurately (especially if
          eventually updated based on the real-world performance of the loan), amounts to the same thing.</p>

                        <>What is a subsidy cost of zero?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>When an agency reports a loan subsidy cost of zero, it means that the government agency has assessed a
        zero probability of the loan not being repaid — in effect, the loan won’t cost the government any money.
        Note that subsidy cost only takes into account the loan itself and does not include administrative costs.</p>]

                        <>Can I see what the ultimate cost to the government was?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>Currently, it’s uncommon for agencies to update subsidy cost data on USAspending, even if new
        information comes to light or a loan recipient defaults; this means that loan spending data is generally less
        accurate than that of other award types.</p>,
        <p>Because of this, we’ve identified loans as an area of data quality concern. We are taking steps, through
          agency outreach and seeking policy change, to improve the accuracy of this data as a measure of federal
          spending.</p>]
