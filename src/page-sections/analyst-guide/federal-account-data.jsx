      accordionContent: [
        <p>Federal accounts are found in the budget that the President submits to Congress for approval. Each federal
          account is comprised of a “family,” or grouping, of specific account numbers known as Treasury Account
          Symbols (TAS), through which spending actually occurs. The accounts give you an idea of how agencies
          receive and spend congressional funding to carry out their programs, projects, and activities. <a

            rel='noopener noreferrer'>Student Financial Assistance</a> are examples of the more than 2,000 unique federal accounts of the U.S. government. Federal accounts also
          have associated Federal Account Symbols to identify them. For example, Student Financial Assistance
          has the Federal Account Symbol 091-0200.</p>

    },
    {
      accordionTitles: [<>With the size of the federal government, how are you be able to identify unique accounts?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>Federal accounts are uniquely identified by the Agency Identifier and the Main Account Code. These
        codes are required for agency financial reporting.</p>,
        <>
          <ul><span className={styles.bold}>Agency Identifier (AID)</span>: This is a 3-digit number that identifies the agency responsible for a
            Treasury account (“091” in the Student Financial Assistance example above).
          </ul>
          <ul><span className={styles.bold}>Main Account Code (MAC)</span>: This 4-digit number forms the basis of the federal account (“0200”
            in the Student Financial Assistance example above).
          </ul>
        </>,
        <p>Each Agency Identifier should have at least one federal account associated with it, so the agency can
          conduct its function and carry out its mission. Despite the name, there are instances where an Agency
          Identifier is shared among more than one agency. In these cases, each agency within the shared Agency
          Identifier will still have at least one federal account of its own.</p>]

      accordionTitles: [<>TAS was mentioned before, what is that?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>A Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) is a code that identifies critical information about each transaction
        that agencies report, such as the length of time that the specific account is available for use by the agency.
        Like federal accounts, each TAS has an Agency Identifier and a Main Account Code, along with several
        other codes:</p>,
      <>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span className={styles.bold}>Agency Identifier (AID)</span>: 3 digits, Identifies the agency responsible for a Treasury account.
            Assigned by Congress.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={styles.bold}>Main Account Code (MAC)</span>: 4 digits, identifies the TAS type and purpose. It cannot be blank.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={styles.bold}>Sub Account Code (SAC)</span>: 3 digits, Identifies a sub-division of the TAS. It cannot be blank. A
            sub-account code of "000" means that the TAS is the parent account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={styles.bold}>Allocation Transfer Agency ID (ATA)</span>: 3 digits, Identifies an agency that receives funds
            through an allocation (non-expenditure) transfer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={styles.bold}>Beginning Period of Availability (BPOA)</span>: 4 digits, Identifies the first year that an appropriation
            account may incur new obligations. This is for annual and multi-year funds only.
            <ul className={styles.ulNoMargin}>
              <i>AND</i>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={styles.bold}>Ending Period of Availability (EPOA)</span>: 4 digits, Identifies the last year that an appropriation
            account may incur new obligations. This is for annual and multi-year funds only.
            <ul className={styles.ulNoMargin}>
              <i>OR (if no BPOA or EPOA)</i>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className={styles.bold}>Availability Type Code (ATC)</span>: 1 digit, Instead of specific years, this one-letter code identifies
            the availability (or time period) for obligations to be made on the appropriation account. A TAS
            will have an “X” if there is an unlimited or indefinite period to incur new obligations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </>,
        <p>In some cases, there may be multiple TASs in one federal account. In these instances, you can roll up to
          the federal account level by combining activity from all TASs that share a Main Account Code and
          Agency Identifier.</p>]
    },
    {
      accordionTitles: [<>How exactly is a TAS different from a federal account?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>Federal accounts are comprised of a TAS or multiple TASs. Let’s break it down to a relatable scenario.
        Say you have a bank account and in that account you have checking, growth, and savings. In this
        scenario, your bank account is the federal account and the checking, growth, and savings are your TASs.
        Checking, growth, and savings have different purposes and are at the level where transactions actually
        take place. These “TASs” would be grouped under your account based on your Social Security Number,
        the same way a federal account has a Federal Account Symbol. Just like checking, growth, and savings,
        the Student Financial Assistance federal account has several related TASs that have different obligation
        amounts.</p>]
    },
    {
      accordionTitles: [<>What does it mean when one agency’s TAS are part of a second agency’s submissions?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>Sometimes the funding associated with a TAS is executed by another agency than the one indicated by
        the Agency Identifier. When this occurs, quite often the executing agency will submit the financial and
        award information associated with the TAS. Since the funding was assigned by Congress to the agency
        indicated by the Agency Identifier, we group by Agency Identifier so that users can see both the
        budgetary resources assigned to the agency as well as the spending that flows from the related accounts.</p>]

    {
      accordionTitles: [<>What data is used to populate the federal accounts page on USAspending.gov?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>The information that displays on the federal account page on USAspending.gov comes from the quarterly
        agency submissions. The account snapshot at the beginning of the page is data from the Appropriation
        Account Detail File (File A). The “Spending Over Time” and “Spending By Category” sections come
        from the information in the Object Class and Program Activity Detail File (File B). The “Spending by
        Award” section is from the Award Financial Detail File (File C) and the Award and Awardee attribute
        files (Files D1 and D2). </p>]

      accordionTitles: [<>How can I see the federal accounts for prior years?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>Prior to May 2017, agencies were not required to submit their financial data to be published on
        USAspending. The DATA Act of 2014 required that agency financial data be available to the public, to
        begin by May 2017. However, you may see agency financial data for 2017 and since then, by filtering by
        fiscal year. In addition, you can see similar – but not exactly the same – information in <a
          href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/appendix/' target='_blank'
