      accordionContent: [
        <p>Contract and financial assistance data both include fields for funding and awarding agencies. This
          information is relevant when the funding agency is different from the awarding agency. In certain cases,
          one federal agency may provide money to fund a contract or a grant, which is administered by another
          agency. </p>,
        <p><span className={styles.bold}>Note</span>: Some contracts have multiple funding agencies, if the activities provided are of interest to multiple
          agencies, but it can only have one awarding agency. Contract data only has the capacity to list one
          funding agency; if a contract is funded by multiple agencies, the document will list the agency that
          provides the most funding.</p>,
        <p>While contract and grant data does not reflect multiple funding sources, this information can be found
          through the financial side of the data, which shows all of the funding agencies (not just the predominant
          one) per transaction. You can use award identifiers (the FAIN for grants and the PIID for contracts) to
          link details in the award world (recipient information, awarding agency, etc.) to the financial side, where
          you can find more information about the funding agency.</p>

      accordionTitles: [<>What is the difference between an awarding agency and a funding agency?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>The awarding agency is the agency that creates and administers a contract, while the funding pays for the
        underlying goods and services provided. In most cases, the awarding and funding agency are the same.
        The division of funding and awarding agencies benefits many smaller agencies, who may not have the
        staff available to execute contracts.</p>]

      accordionTitles: [<>Where is the full list of sub-tier agencies?</>,
                        <>How are sub-tier agencies managed over time?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>NSub-tier agencies are the bureaus or divisions of larger federal agencies. For example the IRS is a sub-tier
        component of Treasury, as the FBI is for the Department of Justice. In June 2016, OMB posted an
        authoritative list of sub-tier agencies on MAX.gov; USAspending.gov made a copy of this list, adding
        historical sub-tier codes and names to ensure backwards compatibility and to allow the data to display
        properly on USAspending.gov.<br/>
        Currently, the <a
          href='https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-backend/blob/development/dataactvalidator/config/agency_list.csv' target='_blank'
          rel='noopener noreferrer'>list</a> of sub-tier agencies is static, and it will remain static until GSA launches a tool called
        Federal Hierarchy on beta.sam.gov, which is expected in the coming months.</p>,
        <p>Federal agencies will be responsible for using this tool to manage their agency structure (including SubTier and Office). This tool will provide a comprehensive and up-to-date list of all Sub-Tiers and Offices,
          which USAspending.gov will access via API or daily data download.</p>]

    {
      accordionTitles: [<>Help! Why are there so many agency fields?</>,
                        <>Which one do I use?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>Different fields are available for contracts and other types for financial assistance. To find what you’re
          looking for, it’s important to note the distinction between <span className={styles.bold}>funding agencies</span> and <span className={styles.bold}>awarding agencies</span>.
          Funding agencies are those that actually provide funding for awards, while awarding agencies are those
          that administer the awards; in most cases, the funding agency and the awarding agency are the same
          entity.</p>,
        <p>There are additional layers of hierarchy within funding and awarding agencies, which are represented by
          different organizational identifiers. These additional identifiers may or may not be completed for a given
          record, depending on the record type. They include the following:</p>,
        <><ul>
            <li>Awarding Agency
              <ul>
                <li>Awarding sub-tier agency
                  <ul>
                    <li>Awarding office</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Funding Agency
              <ul>
                <li>Funding sub-tier agency
                  <ul>
                    <li>Funding office</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul></>,
        <p>In summary, if you’re interested in learning who funded various awards, refer to funding agency fields. If
          you want to know who’s managing those awards, refer to awarding agency fields</p>]
