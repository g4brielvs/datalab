    {
      accordionTitles: [
        <>How do I uniquely identify contracts, since there are several modifications?</>
      ],
      accordionContent: [
        <p>You can use a few data elements to help you identify contracts. These are the Procurement Instrument
          Identifier (PIID), the Parent Award Identifier (PAID), and the awarding sub-tier agency. All contracts
          have a PIID. If a given PIID has been reused (used by multiple agencies), you’ll need to use both the PIID
          and the PAID to identify a contract. (Note: To uniquely identify a transaction, you’ll need the PIID,
          Parent PIID, awarding sub-tier agency, modification, and transaction number.)</p>,
        <p>It’s important to keep in mind that one record in USAspending.gov does not necessarily equal one
          contract; rather, one record equals one action taken on a contract (be that the creation of a contract or the
          modification to an existing contract).</p>
      ]
    },
    {
      accordionTitles: [<>How do I view all contracts under a given recipient for a particular time frame?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>Each contract recipient has a recipient identifier known as a DUNS number. For most recipients, viewing
        all contracts is as simple as identifying and filtering by that DUNS number</p>,
        <p>Larger entities with multiple locations or departments may have multiple DUNS numbers, which makes it
          complicated to use this identifier alone to view all the contracts associated with a particular recipient (and
          within a particular timeframe). Viewing by Global Parent DUNS Number can be a good alternative for
          these recipients. You can also filter or subset contract data by: <span className={styles.bold}>AwardeeOrRecipientLegalEntityName</span>, or
          <span className={styles.bold}>Vendor Doing As Business Name and grant data by: UltimateParentLegalEntityName.</span></p>,
        <p>Recipient Profiles, which are coming soon to USAspending.gov, will compile all the contracts for a given
          recipient, making the data easier to navigate and use.</p>]
    },
    {
      accordionTitles: [<>What is the definition of PIID and PAID and when do I need to use them? </>],
      accordionContent: [<p>A PIID is a unique identifier assigned to a federal contract, purchase order, basic ordering agreement,
        basic agreement, and/or blanket purchase agreement. It’s used to track the contract and any modifications
        or transactions related to it. Per the FAR, starting in October 2017 PIIDs for new contracts are unique
        across government; the new PIID format includes the Office Code, which renders it unique from all other
        PIIDs</p>,
        <p>The PAID is the Parent Award Identifier (PAID). Not all PIIDs have PAIDs. If a given PIID has been
          reused (used by multiple agencies), you’ll need to use both the PIID and the PAID to identify a contract.</p>]
    },
    {
      accordionTitles: [<>What are the cases for when they'll be complete/empty?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>The PIID field should never be blank — all awards have PIIDs. The PAID field might be blank, and this
        is nothing to be concerned about; the PAID field will be blank if the award has a unique PIID (in other
        words, one that hasn’t been reused). Keep in mind that if an award does not have a unique PIID, you’ll
        need to use the PAID to differentiate it from other awards.</p>]

    {
      accordionTitles: [<>What are IDVs? Do they involve double-counting with contracts under them?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>Indefinite Delivery Vehicles (IDVs) are vehicles that facilitate the delivery of supply and service orders.
        Types of IDVs include:</p>,
        <>
          <ul>
            <li>Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)</li>
            <li>Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA)</li>
            <li>Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC)</li>

          </ul></>]
    },
    {
      accordionTitles: [<>Which fields of transactions should be summed up to find the current value of a contract?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>As we stated previously, a record doesn’t necessarily represent a single contract; rather, one record
        represents one action taken on a contract.</p>,
        <p>If a contract is represented by a single record (that is, if it has no modifications), you can look at that
          record to determine its current value (the action obligation elements).</p>,
        <p>If a contract is represented by several records (that is, if it has modifications), you’ll need the total action
          obligations for the original contract plus all of the modifications to determine the current value. </p>,
        <p>Finally, it’s worth noting that if all initially obligated money isn’t used, the last modification will display
          a negative amount. For example, if an initial contract was made for $10,000 and an agency only used
          $9,000 of that initial obligation, the last record would display an amount of -$1,000.
