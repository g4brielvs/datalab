      accordionContent: [
        <p>A contract is an agreement between the federal government and a recipient to provide goods and services
          to the government for a fee. Grants are a form of financial assistance, where a federal agency transfers a
          thing of value (either money or in kind) to the recipient in order for the recipient to carry out activities or
          projects to benefit the public.</p>,
        <p>Because of these differences, contract and financial assistance data have different structures, fields, and
          categorization systems. For example, financial assistance awards are categorized by the Catalogue of
          Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) tags, where contracts are categorized with Product and Service
          Codes. Furthermore, contract and financial assistance data are provided to USAspending.gov from two
          distinct feeder systems. Contract data is entered into a system called the Federal Procurement Data
          System (FPDS), which is managed by GSA, while financial assistance data is entered directly into a
          Treasury-managed system called the Broker.</p>

      accordionTitles: [<>What’s the difference between an obligation and an outlay?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>An obligation is a promise made by the government to spend funds immediately or at a later date as a
        result of a series of actions. An outlay takes place when those funds are actually spent, or paid out. For
        example, when the government enters into a contract or grant, typically, the entire value of the contract or
        grant is obligated. This is done because the government expects to make payments totaling that amount,
        so long as the agreed-to actions take place. When the government actually makes payments to a
        contractor or grantee, then the obligation to pay becomes an outlay.</p>]
    },
    {
      accordionTitles: [<>What are negative obligations?</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>Negative obligations, or de-obligations, occur when agencies decrease previous obligations to correct
        errors or to reflect new information (for example, that the price of a project was lower than expected).</p>,
        <p>De-obligations are common in instances where the scope of a project changes. For example, if the
          government awards a contract for $1 million, but later decides that it only requires work totaling
          $400,000, it would de-obligate $600,000, which would show up as negative $600,000 in USAspending
          data.</p>]

        report outlays related to contracts and financial assistance on an optional basis. This data is not currently
