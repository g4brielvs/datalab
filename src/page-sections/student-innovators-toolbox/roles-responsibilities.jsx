  introSentence: <p>The roles, responsibilities, and academic and time expectations vary for each type of engagement.
    We sketch these out below, but they are not set in stone. They are completely open to discussion to ensure both the
    institution’s and the Data Lab team's needs are being fulfilled.</p>,

          Roles & Responsibilities
        </h1>,
        <p>The Data Lab team works with a professor to develop a useful dataset (clean or raw dataset) for a specific course.
          We will work with the professor to answer any questions and ensure that he/she is comfortable with the content
          and data structure in order to incorporate the dataset into the course. These interactions can be via email,
          phone, screen shares, or video conferences—whatever works best.</p>,
        <h1>
          Academic & Time Expectations
        </h1>,
        <p>We provide professors datasets and assistance through Engagements 1 and 2 as an upfront, pre-semester activity
          to allow enough time for professors to ask questions, understand the data, and incorporate the dataset into
          their curriculum. The Data Lab team is happy to field questions as they arise but, for the most part, the time
          or interactions required are mainly prior to a semester in order to get the right dataset for the course
          prepped, explained, and incorporated into the syllabus. We consider this a low level of commitment for both
          the professors and our team.</p>

        <h1>
          Roles & Responsibilities
        </h1>,
        <p>The roles/responsibilities and time expectations are similar to above, with the expectation of slightly less
          “hand-holding” in this engagement. This engagement may be useful for long-term, and student-driven projects,
          such as an undergraduate thesis, master’s capstone project, or even a PhD thesis.</p>,
        <p>We are happy to meet with the students to get them started, but we will not offer a problem statement or task
          to execute. The students will explore the data themselves in order to decide on a problem they want to explore
          and answer, or a visualization/tool they want to build. The onus is on the student for the thought leadership
          and the drive to push the project along. In this engagement, there may likely be an undergraduate or graduate
          advisor assisting the student. We will work with the professor, advisor, etc. to establish what role our team
          will play in any evaluation (e.g. providing grades, answering surveys, etc.). However, all this is up for
          negotiation depending on your institution’s needs!</p>,
        <h1>
          Academic & Time Expectations
        </h1>,
        <p>These types of real world projects typically span a full semester and the students will likely be in a course
          or club that provides expectations and support during this time period. Students may have academic requirements
          for the course that are not necessarily required by the Data Lab team (e.g. course readings, literature reviews,
          etc.). Students are expected to put in the regular number of hours required for one semester-long course,
          including classes, meetings and work time and to provide a final product. We will be available for questions
          and regular communication and expect progress reports on a regular basis (e.g., once every two weeks). Lastly,
          the team will attend a presentation or demonstration of the final product.</p>]
