        <p className={styles.bold}>While each user-centered design (UCD) process can look different for every team,
          there are four main stages to every UCD approach.</p>,
        <ul>
          <li>
            Observe and learn about the people for whom you are solving a problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ideate or generate ideas about potential options that could address the challenge your target audience faces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create or make a prototype.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check or test the chosen prototype to see if it actually solves the problem people are facing.
          </li>
        </ul>,
        <p>In reality, however, UCD is an incredibly iterative process—the stages do not flow linearly from one to the
          next. You may begin brainstorming and realize you need more information, returning your team back to the
          observation and learning stage. You may build a prototype, test it, and find out it doesn’t quite work,
          sending you back to the ideation phase.</p>,
        <p><span className={styles.bold}>The ultimate purpose of UCD when tackling any challenge is to keep your target
          audience first and foremost to any solution – how would they naturally navigate a situation or interact with
          something? – and build for them. </span>The prototype should cater to the people facing the challenge, not the
          other way around; if you build a grand solution that no one will use, you don’t have a solution at all.</p>,

        <p><span className={styles.bold}>The benefits of employing a user-centered design approach are numerous. </span>The
          solution is much more likely to be effective and adopted by the target audience when it was built from the ground
          up with them in mind and tested throughout multiple phases. UCD can also reduce risk by allowing for quick,
          iterative stages that are nimble enough to make changes as new information is acquired and incorporated. Surprises
          are limited in the final release of the solution given the rounds of testing of the various prototypes
          throughout the lifecycle of the project. Once an idea moves into a higher-fidelity phase (e.g., a mock up that
          looks exactly how the phone app will be developed), resources (time, money, etc.) can be spent more confidently
          and wisely, knowing that quirks have been ironed out and unknown issues have been discovered and addressed
          earlier (e.g., with paper prototypes).</p>,
        <p><span className={styles.bold}>We encourage teams that we partner with to adopt this approach. </span>Once a team
          identifies the target audience or who may be impacted by the project, we want students to go out and observe
          or interview people to gather and test the initial data. Later, once ideas have been generated and a prototype
          has been created, students should test the concept before switching fully into implementation mode. How would
          they use the project? What do they expect each thing to do? Now that they have something to react to, are
          there other issues they foresee? Incorporate the users’ feedback into any final solution or prototype.</p>

      accordionTitles: [<>Tips to finding your client</>],
      accordionContent: [<p>In a client-based project, students analyze a policy problem, a challenge or missed
        opportunity and – with faculty guidance – develop recommendations to address it. Hence, a client with an
        interesting problem is key to producing a successful product or analysis.</p>,
      <p>But finding a client and a policy problem can be challenging. Here are a few tips to begin this essential
          first step of your product or analysis:</p>,
      <div className={styles.textIndent}>
        <p><span className={styles.bold}>Follow your interests. </span>Connect with an organization working on problems
          you’re interested in. For example, a local homeless service organization might be an appropriate client for
          students interested in preventing and ending homelessness or alleviating poverty. Learn about the organization’s
          goals and current initiatives. Then, work with the client to define a suitable and manageable policy problem
            or analysis that can provide value or insights to them.</p>
        <p><span className={styles.bold}>Leverage your network. </span>Reach out to your alumni and faculty networks and
          get an introduction to the problems and challenges their respective organizations are facing. Then, conduct
            initial research and identify an opportunity for a client organization.</p>
        <p><span className={styles.bold}>Think local. </span>Consider organizations/agencies you’re familiar with.
          These can be your high school, your city council, nonprofits in your community, or other small, public
          organizations where you may have a connection. Most of these organizations would be happy to have students
          completing a master’s degree to help increase understanding of the distribution of federal funds and their
            impact.</p>
        <p><span className={styles.bold}>Develop your subject matter niche. </span>Take advantage of your student
          status and contact professionals on social media, via email or phone! Consider policy issues or topics in
          your field of study and share interesting insights or ideas. Next, meet with them and ask if they have a
          project that you can conduct for them to complete your master’s degree. You should bring some examples of
            project ideas that you have, too.</p>
