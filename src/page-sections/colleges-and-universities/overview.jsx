                non-federal funding sources. Investments from the federal government were $149 billion of the total,
                representing 3.6% of federal spending. This money flowed into colleges and universities through three
                main vehicles: federal student aid, grants, and contracts. In our analysis we focused on data from
                nonprofit institutions that offer a program of two years or more.`}
