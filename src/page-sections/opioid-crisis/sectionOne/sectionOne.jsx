                         led to over 400,000 deaths in the United States since 2000? The opioid epidemic, also referred to as the opioid
                         crisis, is a term that refers to the rapid increase in the use of prescription and nonprescription opioid drugs.
                         According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, an opioid is a class of drugs that can include the illegal
                         drug heroin, synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and prescribed pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone,
                         codeine, and morphine.
