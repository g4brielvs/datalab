          <p>
            To accurately determine the amount the federal government spends addressing homelessness, we reviewed federal
            program descriptions using the CFDA, looking for any mention of keywords related to homelessness.
          </p>
          <p>
            We developed a ranking system to assess whether individuals experiencing homelessness would directly benefit
            from these programs, and categorized these programs by the type of service they provide. To learn more about
            the development of our ranking and categorization systems visit our <a
            href='https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/datalab' target='_blank'
            rel='noopener noreferrer'>Github page</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following example illustrates our process: the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program provides services
            to homeless veterans looking for jobs, which we classified as employment-related. We presented these programs
            to the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, who recommended that we remove several programs where the
            majority of funds went to beneficiaries other than individuals experiencing homelessness.

          <p>
            We used this dataset to identify all grant spending from USAspending.gov for the programs we determined to
            have a direct relation to homelessness. As part of our analysis, we identified three categories of grant
            awards in USAspending.gov data that are relevant to our work:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Grant awards for a CoC area (an administrative region recognized by HUD), or were awarded to
              organizations within its geographic area;</li>
            <li>Grant awards that didn't have specific location data; and</li>
            <li>Grant awards that supported organizations across a state.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To create our data visualization, we mapped funding amounts for the programs that fell within a CoC area
            using mapping files provided by HUD. The data was updated as of January 2018.
          </p>
        </>
    },
    {
      name: <>Linking additional data to Continuum of Care areas</>,
      sources:
        <>
          <div className={styles.bold}>Area and population:</div>
          <p>
            Most CoC areas are based on the geographic boundaries of one or more counties. Where that is true for
            counties, the data for counties in the CoC areas were added together to get the total for the CoC area. In
            instances where boundaries were determined by cities or cities and counties, the data for the city was
            subtracted from the surrounding county and the county/city data was allocated to the correct CoC area.
          </p>
          <div className={styles.bold}>Income and Rent:</div>
          <p>
            The lowest geographic area for income was county. For this reason both counties and cities were linked to
            the data for their county. Using the population data previously described, we used a weighted average based
            on median lowest quintile income of the geographic area that make up each CoC area, based on the population
            of each area.
          </p>
          <div className={styles.bold}>Mental Health, illicit drug use, and alcohol dependence or abuse:</div>
          <p>
            The data for these metrics are based upon geographic areas created by HHS. Like CoC areas, these areas are
            largely based upon counties. We linked these geographic areas to counties and created a weighted average
            for each CoC area based upon population.
          </p>
          <p>
            This data was linked to the HUD PIT Count and Housing Inventory Count, as well as the total funding data.

      sources:

          <p>
            To find the optimal number of clusters to target for this analysis we used a method that looks at the
            percentage of variance explained as a function of the number of clusters. The optimal value comes when the
            marginal gain for adding more clusters begins to level off. We chose five clusters as our target.
          </p>
          <p>
            We tested several unsupervised clustering algorithms. The method we employed was Fuzzy C Means, a data
            clustering technique that allows one piece of data to belong to two or more clusters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The clusters were then further segmented by population density, in an attempt to manage the size of the
            final clusters, but also to visualize areas with similar behavior and conditions for comparison.

          Serious mental illness (SMI) is defined as having a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder,
          other than a developmental or substance use disorder, as assessed by the Mental Health Surveillance Study
          (MHSS) Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth
          Edition-Research Version-Axis I Disorders (MHSS-SCID), which is based on the DSM-IV. SMI included individuals
          with diagnoses resulting in serious functional impairment. For details, see Section B in the "2011-2012
